# My Awesome Assistant

![alt text](images/full.png)

This is my super cool smart speaker and assistant. You can talk with the assistant by using wake word "Alexa" and it will answer back!

The case is super simple, I don't need any extra components since I just wanted to give a basic introduction into Onshape! (You put here what makes your speaker special!)

Here's the screen recording (with audio) of my assistant: [./demo.webm](demo.webm)
